<h2>Socially unintelligent yet technologically sophisticated</h2>

<p>
  What if the tech industry isn’t facing issues? <br>What if the tech industry IS the issue?<br>

In the past 25 years technology has improved immensely and stimulated not only the economy, but also our world.

</p>

<h2>The United States, second in the world with the highest technological innovations.</h2>
<p>
According to <a href="http://smashingtopten.com/top-ten-rated-countries-with-the-highest-technological-innovations-in-the-world/technology">this article</a> the United States is 2nd in the world with the highest technological innovations.<br>

The article says, “Silicon Valley is the source of Internet in the world and it is in the USA where greatest technology companies originate. For instance, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Intel, and Dell among other prominent companies offering technological solutions in the world based in USA. In the US, technology is in use in almost in all life aspects, homes, medicine, and military among many other applications. Space explorations are only in US where space companies provide these privatized space explorations. US military is the most powerful in the world due to its use of sophisticated technology and skills and the most powerful air force. In the US, crime detection in any part of their region using their technology, proving that they must be ahead of many other nations in terms of technology.”

<h2>What's Connection?</h2>
<p>
Although technology has contributed to our world in a very valuable way, we don’t realize how technology is changing humanity and how we interact with one another. <br>

In a face-paced/technology based world, good conversation has become rare and genuine human connection has become obsolete. <br>

When is the last time you went out to dinner and didn’t see everyone on his or her phones? Everyday and everywhere, we’re substituting true human interaction with technology. <br>
</p>

<h2>Can technology affect our children?
</h2>

<p>
  As adults we can recognize the lack of communication because we’re old enough to remember it wasn’t always like this. The children of this generation will not have this luxury. This it the only world they know. This is the only way the know how to “communicate”.  The saddest thing about our future generations is that they will be socially unintelligent yet technologically sophisticated.
