<h2>What Mr.Steel Says About Stereotype Threat</h2>
<p>
  What is a stereotype exactly? Stereotype is defined as a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. Claude M. Steele introduced the theory "Stereotype Threat". Steele says, "stereotype threat," is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that Stereotype. Call it subconscious self-handicapping. Now, let us see how stereotype threat can affect an individual. Here we go!
</p>

<h2>My Personal Stereotype Threat?</h2>

<p>
  I am fortunate enough to have not experienced Stereotype Threat in my childhood or teen years. The ironic part about writing this blog is that since I have started DBC I have experienced it!
</p>

<p>I always knew there would be people attending DBC that are smarter than me, older than me, have more programming experience than me, etc.  In my head, I am that girl who "doesn't have any programming background or experience".  I'm realizing now that maybe I've been using that mindset as a crutch. I'm subconsciously expecting myself to have a harder time understanding the material, move at a slower pace, use the extensions, etc.; all because I'm that "girl without any programming experience". Every time any of these things happen I am confirming my own mental stereotype and further doubting my capabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Last week I actually had a breakdown. Because I had to use ANOTHER extension for last weeks work, I felt like a failure. I felt that after week 5 I had already screwed up my only big chance to succeed and create a bright future for myself. Despite the vulnerability assignments where we opened up with one another about our fears with attending DBC, it didn't stop the thoughts I have about myself. But now, everything has changed.
</p>

<h2>My Realization</h2>


<p>
  I realize now that I am NOT that "girl without any programming experience". I am simply an individual who happens to not have any programming background or experience. I am a student at DBC learning a brand new (very challenging) subject. I am struggling because I am struggling, and that doesn't necessarily have to have meaning. Although it's very elementary, my biggest realization is that I am who I am at this point in time. All I can do is strive to be better than I was yesterday.  I, myself, am my biggest competition.
