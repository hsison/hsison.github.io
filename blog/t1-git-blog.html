    <h2>Git Bloggin'</h2>
      <h2>10.12.2014</h2>


      <p>You might ask what are the benefits of version control? Version control keeps track of your files and remembers all of the changes that you've made and when you made them. If you happen to make an error and can't quite figure out when or how you made it, you can use version control to take a look back in time.</p>
      <p>How does git help you keep track of changes? Git is a type of version control software (reference question 1) living on your computer. Git saves the contents of your files and creates a sort of snapshot when you commit (submit) your changes. If in the future you want to reference a previous change or error you will be able to do so on Git.</p>
      <p>Why use GitHub to store your code? GitHub is accessible ONLINE. Anyone who knows the first thing about technology knows that it can turn on you in a matter of seconds. One minute your computer is fine and then next it won't turn back on and is flashing an error screen at you (I'm speaking from experience here). Storing your information online is the best most convenient part about living in an age of advanced technology. It allows you to access your code anywhere and anytime as long as you have Wi-Fi.</p>
