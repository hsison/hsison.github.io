<h2>Conflict & Growing Pains</h2>
<p>
  As a little girl my mom would always tell us, "use your words", when my sisters and I would start being mean to each other. We quickly learned that words are powerful in many different ways. Throughout my entire life, I have paid very close attention to words. Words have the power to uplift someone and tear someone down, without lifting a finger. The best thing about words is that you have control over how you use them.
</p>

<p>
  Growing up in a very religious home I was taught a variety of things. I was taught how to be a Christian. When I say Christian I don't mean your typical go to church once on Sunday type of Christian. It was much more than that. It was a lifestyle. Being a part of the Pentecostal religion meant we were restricted on many things. We weren't allowed to cut our hair, wear pants, makeup, jewelry, curse, drink, and obviously premarital sex was prohibited.
</p>

<p>
  Being a teenager, I wanted to do all of the things I wasn't allowed to do throughout my life, so I did. Fast forward to my late teenage years I realized I didn't want to follow the religion altogether. I realized that I really didn't agree with any of it. After this realization, I didn't know what to do or how to act. I would party with my friends on the weekends and then be in church on Sunday. I felt horrible about being a hypocrite. I felt trapped because I didn't want to disappoint my parents, but I didn't want to live a double life either.
</p>

<p>
  Finally when I was nineteen I decided I needed to tell my parents the truth. I knew my parents would prefer honesty even if it hurt. They always told us to be honest no matter what. So honest with them I was. After many weeks of anxiety, stress, and trying to figure out a way to tell them I finally did. My dad was on his computer in his room and I walked in and asked if I could talk to him. Of course he didn't mind so I sat down and took a deep breath. I told him, "Look dad, there are many things that I'm not being honest with you about and I'm just going to come out and say it all. I've had anxiety thinking about telling you but I don't want to lie to you and mom anymore. Here it goes. When I leave here I wear pants, cut my hair, wear makeup, and Brock and I have been having sex for four years."
</p>

<p>
  I'm not kidding when I say this is how it went down. His face dropped and he was heartbroken. It was hard to see my dad like that but it was the only way I could really be honest with him. After a long, long conversation it was done. Two weeks later I decided I was going to move out and explore the world on my own terms. My parents respected my decision and never once made me feel guilty for telling them the truth. Obviously at first it was awkward coming home to visit but it eventually became less awkward.
</p>

<p>
  My family is closer now more than we have ever been before and for that I am so grateful. Last month my dad visited my new home that my fiance and I bought and he was so proud of us. He told me, "You know what Hannah I just realized something. You really are an adult now and I'm so proud of you and everything you've done". Even if it took him four years to realize it, I'm sure glad he did.
</p>

<p>
  If I had the chance to go back and change anything I really wouldn't. Growing pains hurt and that's just life. Moral of the story, honesty always wins. Like my mom always said, "Use your words", and make them worth something. That's what I plan to do.
