<h2>Classes vs. IDs</h2>

<p>What are classes and IDs? What is the best way I can utilize them in my code? If you are anything like me you are always asking why. Well here are my answers. Disclaimer: I am not a professional, just a nerd trying to learn some good old fashion HTML and CSS. </p>

<p>Classes and IDs are used for labeling and styling. For my ladies this is equal to how you style your hair and how that labels you as an individual. Ask yourself do you want the label "girl in the office who never does her hair" or "damn look at her locks". Think of your "elements" as hairstyles, each one has different labeling and styling. Moving on from hair lets get into it. </p>


<p>First of all, the two most important things you should know are:<br>

1)  IDs are used for things that appear ONCE per page.<br>
2)  Classes are used for things that appear several times per page.<br>

</p>


<p>When naming IDs and classes you are given the freedom to label every single element differently on your page if you choose, although I would not recommend that for cosmetic purposes. <br>Remember, simplicity never goes out of style.<br>

In your external CSS page you can reference your IDs and classes very simply.
</p>


<p>This is what it would look like when editing your HTML and external CSS sheet when using an ID:<br>
<p>
  In HTML:<br>
  <img src="/Users/admin/Desktop/locationidhtml.png">
</p>


<p>
  In CSS:<br>
<img src= "/Users/admin/Desktop/locationidcss.png">
</p>


<p>
The # symbol before the ID just means "ID of".<br>
<p>

<p>
****Important fact about assigning ID names: when assigning an ID name you CANNOT use spaces only dashes. If you'd like to use more than one word in the name it must look like this: id="multiple-words-like-this" or class="orlikethis".****
</p>

<p>This is what it would look like when editing your HTML and external CSS sheet when using a class:<br>
</p>

<p>
  In HTML:<br>
<img src= "/Users/admin/Desktop/price class html.png">
</p>

<p>
  In CSS:<br>
  <img src= "/Users/admin/Desktop/priceclasscss.png">
</p>

<p>
**The period in .price{} just means class of price.**
</p>

<p>
Classes and IDs give you the chance to label any generic code HTML code making it very specific and personal to you. Because the classes and IDs are typically used for personal review that gives you the freedom to name elements classes or IDs anything you want within reason. You want to make sure these names make sense to YOU and general sense to others incase you want to share the code one day.
 </p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my breakdown of classes and IDs. Until next time my fellow nerds!
