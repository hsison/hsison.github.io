    <h2>Chef's In The Kitchen</h2>
      <h2>10.12.2014</h2>


      <p>After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> I am beyond enthused!</p>

      <p>As I listened to Shereef’s two analogy’s regarding the restaurant mindset and the kitchen mindset, the DBC experience all made perfect sense to me. Because I love to cook (and to eat) this analogy really resonated with me. We are trained at such a young age to live in a constant “restaurant” state of mind. We only pay attention and time to things that seem easy and reasonable on the menu of life. Instead of creating new possibilities and experiences we often just chose what is accessible and easy. I have to admit that is the mindset I initially had when first applying to DBC but now all that has changed.</p>

      <p>My impression of DBC can only be described in one word, family. There is a certain value in the relationships you share with those in your family. You hold them to a different standard because that’s the point of family right? Metaphorically, you cook with them, you make a mess in the kitchen with them, you throw food at their face, etc. You will always have something in common with every single person attending DBC and that is you are a part of the DBC family.</p>

      <p>I am already in love with the DBC culture. I’m only one week into DBC and I already love the energy we all project through cyber space I can’t imagine how awesome it will be once we all unite on campus! I already see myself blooming into a better person, communicator, and future programmer. I really believe I will thrive in this culture.</p>

      <p>My expectations of DBC are entirely different now. I was stuck in the restaurant mentality, menu: ruby on rails, java, and a new job all for $12,000? Although that’s not my mentality now I’m still grateful for it because if it weren’t for that I wouldn’t be where I am now. I am completely ready to take on the kitchen mentality and I’m excited to get my hands dirty and cook up some delicious code stew!</p>

      <p>Despite the little petrified student inside of me I am ready to take on any challenges that may arise. I am looking forward to blowing my OWN mind in DBC!</p>
