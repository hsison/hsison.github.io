<h2>The Low Down On Pairing & Feedback </h2>

<h2>Pairing: What It's All About</h2>
<p>
  Pairing with others can be both difficult yet helpful.<br>

 Working with someone else on a challenge forces you to fully understand the concepts and apply them to your work. When you study on your own, you are in your own head. You're not verbalizing the concepts and challenges, which can be particularly helpful.<br>

Pairing can also be difficult at times because everyone has a different thought process, personality, and understanding of the material.

</p>

<h2>Feedback: Why Do We Hate Criticism?</h2>
<p>
Feedback is beneficial for everyone. Feedback is beneficial when you receive it, give it, and review it.<br>

When I receive feedback I really try to listen to the words and apply them.  I think constructive feedback is absolutely vital to the learning and growing process. As a person I strive to continually grow, learn, and change but I cannot do that if I cannot see what I need to improve. <br>

Giving others feedback is something I can definitely improve. I always want to be the nice person, only lifting others up by kind words rather than constructive ones. <br>

In general  a lot of the times feedback has a negative connotation. Like when your boss does an end of the year evaluation you fear that maybe you haven't met up to his/her standards. So what if you didn't? Maybe you haven't and maybe there is something that you need to improve. Thats why when I give others feedback I am working on really giving them something they can work with, keep doing, or improve.<br>

Being vulnerable is probably on of the hardest things for people do. We are always looking for ways to protect ourselves for the fear that we will get hurt(again). Most breakthroughs happen when you get to a place of true vulnerability. <br>

So next time you pair, give feedback, receive feedback, or even look at others feedback, think about how you're helping that person get closer to their full potential.
