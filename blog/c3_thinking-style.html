<h2>The Mind</h2>
<p>
  What is your thinking/learning style?<br>

According to Anthony F. Gregorc’s Mind Styles article, “No one is a "pure" style. Each of us has a unique combination of natural strengths and abilities.”<br>

Even though I did this personal thinking style test in the prep work before starting Phase 0, I really didn’t understand how powerful it could be to understand yourself/thinking style on a deeper level.

</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>
So far my experience in Phase 0 has been both frustrating and rewarding. <br>I have to be honest and say it’s leaned more toward the frustrating.  I am a very visual/audible learner and have always struggled with reading comprehension on my own. If I watch a video or listen to someone explain something to me I grasp the concepts particularly faster. When reading on my own I find myself loosing concentration in the middle of reading a paragraph or two and throughout my life that has been very challenging.<br>

During week one of Phase 0 we were given a challenge where we were supposed to research time management and productivity. <br>During that assignment I came upon the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8XG02das-A ">How to create a Habit(with Charles Duhigg)</a> .This amazing video talks about how focus, in itself, is a habit. He says, “Focus increases with practice. You need to recognize and keep track of your practice, so you can convince yourself you’re getting better at it”.<br>

He talks about how making the conscious choice to focus, for even ten minutes at a time, that your focus remains very high. He also mentions the importance of breaks. Give yourself time to not be focused.<br>

After watching this video in week one, in combination with the Pomodoro Technique, my focus has improved by probably 40%. To me this is a huge deal. I know that with practice and time my focus will be close to 100% and I am so excited for that.

</p>

<h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
<p>
  According to the Mind Styles article, for the most part I am a Concrete Random Thinker. The article says Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters and that I am. <br>

This explanation of Concrete Random thinkers was absolutely spot on for me.<br>

This learner likes:<br>
• experimenting to find answers<br>
• take risks<br>
• use their intuition<br>
• solving problems independently<br>
They learn best when:<br>
• they are able to use trial-and-error approaches<br>
• able to compete with others<br>
• given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.<br>
What's hard for them?<br>
• Restrictions and limitations<br>
• Formal reports<br>
• Routines<br>
• Re-doing anything once it’s done<br>
• Keeping detailed records<br>
• Showing how they got an answer<br>
• Choosing only one answer<br>
• Having no options<br>


</p>

<h2>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset
</h2>
<p>

In the video above with Charles Duhigg he talks about a book written by Daniel Coyle called “The Talent Code.” Although I’m not an avid reader, I really want to expand my mind and be successful in my future so I will be reading “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle. Also I will be reading Charles Duhigg’s book “The Power of Habit. I will also continue to practice focus and use the Pomodoro Technique in  my daily studies.
