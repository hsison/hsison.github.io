    <h2>Sass, A$%, and Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Before diving deep into classes there are a few things you should know.<br>
      Ruby is an object-oriented language meaning, almost everything appears in Ruby as an object. This means every string, number, and true/false values are ALL OBJECTS.<br>
      Even a class itself is an object that is an instance of the Class class.
    </p>

    <h2>When To Use Classes</h2>

    <p>
      You use a class when you want to specify the form of an object. Classes combine data and methods into one nice little organized package.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Use A Class?</h2>
    <p>
      Although a single block of code is great for minor projects in programming, you need more structure. Ruby overall gives you a structured alternative to other programming languages.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use classes?</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this tutorial you will learn how to create classes and use them. Roll up your sleeves and let's cook up some classes.<br>

      When creating a class you want to start with the keyword class followed by the name of your choosing. That's right, you can name your class anything! Just make sure you name it something reasonable incase other programmers want to read your code. <br>
      Also make sure the first letter of your class name is Capitalized. <br>
      You end your class using the keyword end. Any code in between the class and end keywords will be considered data members of that class.
    </p>

    <h2>What Does A Simple Class Look Like?</h2>
    <p>
      <div style="text-align:left; width:50%; margin:auto; color:white; font-style: italic;border: 1px dotted black; padding: 20px;">
      class Yourmom<br>
      def class members<br>
      end<br>
      end
      </div>
    </p>

    <h2>What Does An Actual Class Look Like?</h2>
    <p>
      <div style="text-align:left; width:50%; margin:auto; color:white; font-style: italic;border: 1px dotted black; padding: 20px;">
      class Store<br>
      def initialize(name,products,workers)<br>
      @name = name<br>
      @products = products<br>
      @workers = workers <br>
      end<br>


      def description<br>
      return "I visited #{@name} and I bought #{@products}."<br>
      end<br>
      end<br>


      costco = Store.new("Costco","printers", "100")<br>
      costco.description<br>

      </div>

      This class is creating a very broad class called Store.Since everything we do in programming is somewhat hypothetical, we're going to think like a computer.<br>

      Every time we create a new instance of the class Store the computer is literally going to think it's creating a store. Every store has a name, products and workers, these variables are accessible to everything within the store class because they are instance variables. <br>
      If you want something specific to only your store you can create what's called "local variables" within one single method.

    </p>

    <h2>Think About Why They Are Called Classes</h2>
    <p>
      The definition of classification is the action or process of classifying something according to shared qualities or characteristics.<br>
      The most important part of this definition is "SHARED QUALITIES OR CHARACTERISTICS". <br>
      This means when were creating classes, ever object within that class is going to have shared qualities or characteristics. <br>

      That's all for today folks!
