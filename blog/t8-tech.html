<h2>Test Driven Development aka TDD</h2>
<p>
  The brain,<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a>, is the one who rediscovered and developed this technique into what it is today.<br>
  Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First, the developer writes an automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, and then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test. Programmers also apply the concept to improve and debug code more efficiently. You might say,"This TDD stuff sounds amazing! How can I use this?" <br>
  You're in luck. Let's do this.
</p>

<h2>How To Use TDD</h2>
<h3>Write A Test</h3>
<p>
The first part to TDD is writing the test. Yes, you write the test before you write the code don't freak out. To write a test you must have a clear understanding of what you want the code to do, i.e. specifications and requirements. You can use cases and user stories to do this.
</p>

<h3>Run the test</h3>
<p>
  You do this to make sure the new test doesn't mistakenly pass without requiring new code and also to make sure the new feature doesn't already exist in your program. The new test should also fail for the expected reason.
</p>

<h3>Get to writin' code</h3>
<p>
  Write some code that will cause the test to pass. This bit of code will probably be ugly but that's why we refactor later. For now, just make sure the code makes the test pass and you can beautify it later.
</p>

<h3>Run the test again</h3>
<p>
  The tests should pass now. If they don't, rewrite your code.
</p>

<h3>Refactor that ugly code</h3>
<p>
  Once your tests and code are happy it's time to beautify. Discover some better variable names, method names, class names, object names, etc.  If there's any repetition make sure to clean that up too.
</p>
