<h2>One of the most important values to me Achievement</h2>
<p>
  Achievement is important to me because it gives me a sense of worth. I don't feel like I'm worthless without achievement, however when I achieve something, I feel like I'm contributing something to the world. I'm using my very little time here on earth wisely. I'm not just soaking up energy. I am doing, being, and achieving. That is what makes me feel alive.

</p>

<h2>Other important life values</h2>

<p>
  On a scale of 1 to 5, these are the values I try to live up to:

<h2>Dr.Hannah will see you now</h2>
<p>
  No I'm not a therapist, but sometimes people come to me for advice. Okay, not really but this here is the latest issue.<br> The last topic someone asked me advice on was of course a boy. One of my friends was asking what I think she should do in this situation with this boy(blah, blah, blah) Typical girl stuff.
</p>

<h2>My Values and Stereotype threat</h2>
<p>
  I feel happy when I reflect on my values. I am constantly trying to better myself by learning and growing. When I don't live up to my personal expectations, that's where my upset derives from.  I definitely think it could help me mediate stereotype threat if I recognized I felt it. Most of the time I don't even realize it.<br>

The best therapy for me in most situations is exercise. If I feel sad, tired, or my brain is just running slow from doing so much homework at DBC, I exercise. It is scientifically proven that exercise benefits not only the body but also the mind. Why not benefit both?
