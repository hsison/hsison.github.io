        About me
      </h1>
      <h2>
        I have a passion for design and a love for technology. I love software development and the quick pace that things morph and change. I surround myself with people and things that inspire me to grow and learn as an individual. I am fluent in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Active Record, Sinatra, and all things design(HTML5, CSS, SASS). I am looking to further my understanding in overall front end development and am currently exploring Angular, Backbone, Ember, and React.

    <div class="about_me">
       <h1>
        Falling in love with programming
      </h1>
      <h2>
         Before learning to program, I never gave thought to the fact that I was capable of one day changing how people interacted with technology. In a world full of endless amounts of technology, I wanted to learn how to control the technology that I was using. My many hobbies include playing the drums, piano, guitar, singing and writing. I also play hockey, basketball, volleyball, and softball. Because I have so many hobbies it was really hard to figure out what I wanted to pursue in the professional world. I wanted to master something and after discovering programming I knew that was my destined mastery. I love that no one person can ever know absolutely everything about every single language or framework. The constant ability to learn something new is what I absolutely love about the programming culture.
