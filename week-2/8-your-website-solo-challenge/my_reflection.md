# 8. Creating your website Reflection

My Website url:

hsison.github.io/blog/index.html

Discuss the following:

My process:

1)First I used the wireframe we created in challenge three for our index page.

2)I then created a basic HTML code to work from.

3)I then chose a color palette using https://color.adobe.com. That really helped me narrow down what font colors, background colors, heading colors, etc that I would use. I like a very simple look so this website was absolutely perfect for my needs.

4)I then went crazy with CSS. Some parts of the CSS page got a little confusing when I started editing margins, padding, etc but I worked through it.


I would like to add a “people you follow” link to my page and an about me. Due to the time I figured that is something I can always edit later. I would also like to add maybe a video or two.

It wasn’t too hard applying the material we learned just more so tedious over anything else.

To Do List:
  Add a “people you follow” link.
  Add a video or two, maybe from the websites I used that really helped me.

I of course used Udemy.com videos,  http://www.w3schools.com, and best of all http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com. It was an absolute life saver. Their videos are easy to follow, fun and entertaining to watch and they REALLY   helped me grasp the concepts.
